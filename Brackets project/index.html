        <h1>High School Life Choices</h1>
            <p>Welcome to HSLC, there's multiple endings that you can replay for them, and of course there's no prizes and achievements. That's all I have to say, hope you enjoy it.</p>
        
        <p>Story:<br>
        You're a 14 years old, a freshman who just got into Highschool life.
            Since you just come here not for long, there's still have tons of time you can spend at. 
        <br>By the way, you have an Asian mother, she required you to get 90 above. And she always nagging, that would bring down your happiness.</p>

    <p>Status is just your status, it might get higher or lower base on your choice.<br>Happiness: Average people is usually 80, but you're lower, due to your nagging mother. When below 60, things happen.<br>Grade: It's average, but your mother likes to compare you with other better kid, and want you to do better. </p>
